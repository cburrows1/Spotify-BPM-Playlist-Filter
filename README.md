# Spotify BPM Playlist Filter

This program accepts a collection of Spotify playlist URLs, a target BPM for the music, and a tolerance decimal for how much variance is allowed in the range around that BPM. For instance: 100 BPM with tolerance 0.1 will select all songs from the supplied playlists that have an average tempo betweeen 90 - 110 BPM.

Then, a new playlist is generated and added to your user profile with your own selected playlist name and only the songs in the BPM range.

This may be helpful for people running or doing physical activity to ensure your music follows a predetermined tempo, and it's all selected from playlists you already enjoy : )
